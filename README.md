Game that guesses your card!</br>
I was watching magic tricks on youtube and it really intrigued me and really made me start thinking. </br>
Because of my need for creation I tried to emulate the majic trick where the magician can always guess the card no matter where you pcik it from. </br>
This is based on the rule of 9 and wrote the code to always pick the right answer.
